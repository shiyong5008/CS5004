CS5005 - Summer 2021 - SF and SV
Lab1. 2021_0513

1. Create a file, survey.txt, with these contents:
   Your full name: Yong Shi
   Any preferred nickname: NA
   Your Canvas section: 51959
   Your physical location (eg SF Bay Area): Dalian China(GMT+8)
   Three things you value (eg financial success? helping others? etc): family/health/financial/
   One life goal that Align program may help achieve: financial
   Your computer make and model: Lenovo/ideapad
   Your computer OS incuding version: Win8.1
   How much RAM: 8G
   How much disk space (used and available): 107/500G

2. Create a folder structure, NOT on your desktop, such as this:
   Documents/cs5004/labs/lab1/etc for your work. Make a new folder for
   each lab. A similar approach is suggested for homeworks, etc.

3. Ensure that IntelliJ CE (v14.0.1 ideally) is installed and working
   https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
   https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2931579&seqNum=4
   For now, do not get distracted by the plethora of advanced features!
   Learn basic usage including folder structure (src, out, idea, .iml)
   java -version will tell you what version you are running.

4. START learning bash or zsh (== command line == Terminal == shell).
   Mac: Find it within Applications/Utilities. Drag to the DOCK.
   Win: At least install PowerShell. Consider full bash.
   I will post some handouts on Piazza. You should know cd, ls, and pwd.
   Also, jshell. (/help and /exit are a good place to start)

5. Review basic differences between Python and Java. Create with IntelliJ:
   a. Hello, World! running in IntelliJ
   b. Get two ints from user and print the sum
   c. Use loop to raise integer to a positive integer power
Please do these on your own, do not look them up on Internet!
It is OK to collaborate within your breakout group on this.

Here is a quick and dirty summary of how to get user input:
    import java.util.Scanner;
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	int myInteger = sc.nextInt();
	String myLine = sc.nextLine();
        sc.close()

6. Get started with GitHub
   https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE

    Install git app for windows or mac (if you don't already have it)
    https://git-scm.com/download/win or
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/

    Learn 7 git commands (be sure you are IN THE RIGHT DIRECTORY first)
      git status
      git clone URL (creates folder with the name of the repository at your current location)
      git add FILENAME (or git add -A)
      git push
      git commit -m "change note"
        Tip: if you forget the "-m" and land in vi by mistake, quit with <ESC>:wq
      git pull
      git (provides detailed docs)

    Link IntelliJ to Github with Ishita's help.

Commit your survey and your 3 Java mini-programs in a folder called lab1 with a
github repository called labs.

Submit the URL for your repository to Canvas as a text comment In case you are
struggling with Github, just upload files directly to Canvas for now. However,
please get help as needed until you get it working.
