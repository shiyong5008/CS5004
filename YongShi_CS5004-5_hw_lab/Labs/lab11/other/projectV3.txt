1. I plan to build a game, because I like to play À×µçRaiden very much, now I
would like to code one for myself to play with for the different difficult levels. 
-No change.

2. I plan to do it by myself, since I am quite junior, I will try best on it. 
-No change.

3. First format now as the snake game we learnt at lecture. Later when finish app course can make it an mobile app. 
-No change.

4. I don't know how many hours may take, but I plan to spent 3 weeks on it with total hours ~45hrs maybe.
-I started to search on line for related pics and materials. Not start coding yet.
-I started to coding now, for the game I separate package as MainFrame, Model, Panel. So I already have the general structure, next step is to get each class working and connect with each other. Forecast can finish in another week.

5. I primary will focus on the MVC and OOD java code itself, try to as much standard and lean as best. 
Game feature may not fancy at beginning, but I can carry on it to later courses like 5610 or 5520 to make it more app focus.
-No change.


thanks - shi,yong


Part B: Create a file, projectV1.txt, containing an initial outline of your
final project idea. You should address the following points. It is OK if some
of the answers change later; just remember that there is not much time.

1. The overall topic of the project (a game, an inventory database, a music
classifier, a tool to defeat "captcha"s involving stop lights, whatever), a
clever algorithm to traverse a certain type of tree -- whatever!). Try to
choose something that is authentically interesting to YOU.

2. Your likely partner(s), if any. Name(s) if known, ideal number if not.

3. Format (e.g., a desktop app, an Android app, a web site with an embedded
Java app? something else?).

4. Your current best estimate of how many person-hours will be required to
complete your project, broken down as follows:
	 - defining
	 - designing
	 - researching
	 - implementing
	 - testing
	 - debugging
and a GRAND TOTAL.

5. One thing you think you may need to learn in order to complete the project.
